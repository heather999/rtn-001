\subsection{DP0.2 - processing} \label{sec:dp0.2}

The Milestone L2-DP-0040 includes re processing on IDF of the data set previously served as part of L2-DP-0020.
This requires a workflow system and associated tools to preferably make this quite automated.
Demonstrating a portable set of cloud enabled tools based on Butler Gen3 and PanDA would help to allay the main risk of moving to a new Data Facility in operations.
As of today, processing based on Butler Gen3 has been limited to a very small scale, and no scalability testing has been performed. For L2-DP-0040 we intend to reprocess DC2 RC6  dataset late in 2021 or early 2022.


\subsubsection {Policy committee}

There are certain decisions which will need to be made are best handled in a smaller forum than DPLT.
This may include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Campaign polices
\item Version of pipelines to use and patches which are needed
\item Version of QA tooling which needs to run (and where/how to run it)
\item Other operational considerations
\end{itemize}

Such decisions will be endorsed by DPLT but advised by a smaller committee more connected to the issues.
The members will be the following (or their delegated representative):

\begin{itemize}
\item Hsin-Fang Chiang
\item Tim Jenness
\item Yusra AlSayyad
\item Leanne Guy
\end{itemize}

This is basically  one representative each from Science Pipelines, V\&V, Middleware, and Execution.
It also serves as a trial for operations proper.
